What WP 
I PRP 
want NN 
to TO 
point NN 
out RB 
here RB 
is VBZ 
that IN 
all DT

ex-liberals NNS

with IN

I PRP 
suppose VBP 
we PRP

classify VB 
Billy NNP

an DT

And CC 
I PRP 
would MD 
further RB 
note NN 
that IN 
they PRP 
all DT

again RB 
-- : 
sang VBD 
in IN 
one NN 
key NN 
or CC 
another DT 
the DT 
same JJ 
song NN 
. . 

Its PRP$ 
refrain NN 
was VBD 
: : 
`` `` 
let VBD 
us PRP 
return NN 
to TO 
the DT 
individualistic JJ

of IN

Adlai NNP

some DT 
reservations NNS 
about IN 
this DT

invoked VBD

Only RB 
Walter NNP

envisioned VBD 
the DT 
possibility NN 
of IN

`` ``

'' '' 
. . 

the DT 
most RB 
notable JJ 
thing NN 
about IN 
the DT 
incantation NN 
of IN 
these DT 
ex-liberals NNS 
was VBD 
that IN 
the DT 
one-time JJ 
shibboleth NN 
of IN

was VBD 
conspicuously RB 
absent JJ

The DT 
second NN 
specific JJ 
comment NN 
was VBD 
the DT 
report NN 
of IN 
Eisenhower NNP 
's POS 
Commission NNP 
on IN 
National JJ 
Goals NNP 
, , 
titled VBN 
Goals NNP 
For IN 
Americans NNPS

They PRP 
, , 
perhaps RB 
, , 
gave VBD 
the DT 
pitch NN 
of IN 
their PRP$ 
position NN 
in IN 
the DT 
preface NN 
where WRB 
it PRP 
was VBD 
said VBD 
that IN 
Eisenhower NNP 
requested VBN 
that IN 
the DT 
Commission NNP 
be VB 
administered VBN 
by IN 
the DT 
American NNP 
Assembly NNP 
of IN 
Columbia NNP 
University NNP 
, , 
because IN 
it PRP 
was VBD 
non-partisan JJ 
. . 

The DT 
Commission NNP 
seems VBZ 
to TO 
represent VB 
the DT 
viewpoint NN 
of IN 
what WDT 
I PRP 
would MD 
call NN 
the DT 
unconscious JJ 
liberal NN 
, , 
but CC 
not RB 
unconscious JJ 
enough JJ 
, , 
to TO 
invoke VB 
the DT 
now RB 
taboo JJ 
symbolism NN 
of IN 
socialism NN

And CC 
here RB 
again RB 
we PRP 
hear VB 
the DT 
same JJ 
refrain NN 
mentioned VBD 
above IN 
: : 
`` `` 
the DT

it PRP

And CC 
the DT 
basic NN 
character NN 
of IN 
that IN

has VBZ 
been VBD 
spiritual JJ 
rather RB

Ralph NNP 
Gabriel NNP 
gave VBD 
it PRP 
the DT 
name NN 
of IN 
Protestant NNP 
philosophy NN

But CC 
there RB

a DT

Here RB 
there RB

an DT

the DT

almost RB 
the DT 
only RB 
`` ``

One PRP

us PRP

this DT

In IN 
any DT

whether IN

a DT

Hence NNP 
the DT 
prime JJ

I PRP

is VBZ 
whether IN

these DT

we PRP

that IN 
whatever WDT

this DT

in IN

, , 
now RB 
the DT 
corporation NN 
per IN

can NN 
not RB 
take VB 
economic JJ

Businesses NNP 
must MD 
develop VB

a DT

of IN 
the DT

ambitions NNS 
of IN 
an DT

having VBG 
purpose NN 
and CC 
comprehensive JJ 
ability NN 
within IN

we PRP 
`` `` 
forced VBN 
'' '' 
individuals NNS

assume VBP 
the DT 
corporate NN 
structure NN 
by IN

of IN

and CC 
other NN 
legal JJ 
statutes NNS 
, , 
we PRP 
adopted VBN 
what WDT 
I PRP 
would MD 
term NN 
`` `` 
pseudo-capitalism NN 
'' '' 
and CC 
so IN 
took VBD 
a DT 
major JJ 
step NN 
toward IN 
socialism NN 
. . 

The DT 
biggest JJS 
loss NN 
, , 
of IN

, , 
was VBD 
the DT

lessened VBN

our PRP$

Socialism NNP 
, , 
I PRP 
grant VB 
, , 
has VBZ 
a DT 
definite JJ 
place NN 
in IN 
our PRP$ 
society NN 
. . 

us PRP 
not RB 
complain VB 
of IN 
the DT 
evils NNS 
of IN 
capitalism NN 
by IN 
referring VBG

a DT

that IN

not RB 
truly RB 
capitalistic JJ

Some DT 
forms NNS 
of IN 
capitalism NN 
do VB 
indeed RB 
work NN 
-- : 
superb JJ 
organizations NNS 
, , 
a DT 
credit NN

But CC 
the DT 
pseudo-capitalism NN 
which WDT 
dictates VBZ 
our PRP$ 
whole NN 
economy NN 
as IN 
well RB 
as IN 
our PRP$ 
politics NNS 
and CC 
social JJ 
life NN 
, , 
will NN 
not RB 
stand VB 
close JJ 
scrutiny NN

Its PRP$ 
pretense NN 
to TO 
operate VB 
in IN 
the DT 
public NN

is VBZ 
little JJ 
more RB 
than IN 
a DT 
sham NN 
. . 

It PRP 
serves VBZ 
only RB 
its PRP$ 
own JJ 
stockholders NNS 
and CC 
poorly RB 
at IN 
that IN

As IN 
a DT 
creative JJ 
enterprise NN 
, , 
its PRP$ 
abilities NNS 
are VBP 
primarily RB 
in IN 
`` ``

creative JJ

its PRP$

( ( 
an DT

made VBD 
possible JJ 
by IN

mandatory JJ 
) )

As IN 
to TO

it PRP 
is VBZ 
notorious JJ 
for IN 
its PRP$ 
callous JJ

except IN 
where WRB 
it PRP 
depends VBZ 
on IN 
them PRP 
for IN

The DT 
corporation NN 
in IN 
America NNP 
is VBZ 
in IN 
reality NN 
our PRP$ 
form NN 
of IN 
socialism NN 
, , 
vying VBG 
in IN 
a DT 
sense NN 
with IN 
the DT 
other NN 
socialistic JJ 
form NN 
that IN 
has VBZ 
emerged VBD 
within IN 
governmental JJ 
bureaucracy NN

But CC 
while NN 
the DT 
corporation NN 
has VBZ 
all DT 
the DT 
disadvantages NNS 
of IN 
the DT 
socialist JJ 
form NN 
of IN 
organization NN 
( ( 
so IN 
cumbersome JJ 
it PRP 
can NN 
not RB 
constructively RB 
do VB 
much RB 
of IN 
anything NN 
not RB

with IN 
its PRP$

, , 
unluckily RB 
it PRP 
does VBZ 
not RB 
have VB 
the DT 
desirable JJ 
aspect NN 
of IN

, , 
the DT 
motivation NN 
to TO 
operate VB 
for IN 
the DT 
benefit NN 
of IN 
society NN 
as IN 
a DT 
whole NN

So RB 
we PRP 
are VBP 
faced VBN 
with IN 
a DT 
vast JJ 
network NN 
of IN 
amorphous JJ 
entities NNS 
perpetuating VBG

in IN 
whatever WDT

they PRP 
can NN 
, , 
without IN

to TO 
the DT 
needs NNS 
of IN 
society NN 
, , 
controlling VBG 
society NN 
and CC 
forcing VBG

it PRP 
a DT 
regime NN 
representing VBG 
only RB 
the DT

needs NNS 
for IN

The DT 
corporation NN 
has VBZ 
a DT 
limited JJ 
, , 
specific JJ 
place NN 
in IN 
our PRP$ 
society NN

Ideally RB 
speaking VBG 
, , 
it PRP 
should MD 
be VB 
allowed VBN 
to TO

only RB 
where WRB 
the DT

a DT 
great JJ 
stake NN 
in IN 
the DT 
continuity NN 
of IN 
supply RB 
or CC 
services NNS 
, , 
and CC 
where WRB 
the DT 
actions NNS 
of IN 
a DT 
single JJ 
proprietor NN 
are VBP 
secondary JJ 
to TO 
the DT 
needs NNS 
of IN 
society NN

Examples NNS 
are VBP 
in IN 
public NN 
utilities NNS 
, , 
making NN 
military JJ 
aircraft NN

accessories NNS 
, , 
or CC 
where WRB 
the DT

and CC 
risk NN

would MD 
be VB 
too RB 
great JJ 
for IN 
a DT

impossible JJ

the DT

form NN 
, , 
e.g. FW 
constructing VBG 
major JJ 
airports NNS

Thus RB 
, , 
if IN 
corporations NNS 
are VBP 
not RB 
to TO 
run NN 
away RB 
with IN 
us PRP

they PRP

In IN 
all DT

areas NNS 
, ,

initiative JJ 
of IN 
the DT 
`` ``

Proprietorship NNP 
Avoiding VBG

Mr. NNP

After IN

we PRP

Mr. NNP 
Lyford NNP

He PRP

: : 
`` `` 
At IN

it PRP

As IN

we PRP

at IN

Such JJ 
activity NN 
may MD 
or CC 
may MD 
not RB

but CC 
it PRP

frequently RB

an DT

defensiveness NN 
that IN 
has VBZ 
undermined VBN 
our PRP$ 
effort NN

The DT 
defensiveness NN 
has VBZ 
been VBD 
exaggerated JJ 
by IN 
another DT

, , 
our PRP$ 
tendency NN

the DT 
`` ``

Shocked JJ

One PRP

you PRP

that IN

The DT 
maturity NN 
in IN
