What WP 
I PRP 
want VB 
to TO 
point NN 
out RB 
here RB 
is VBZ 
that IN 
all DT

ex-liberals NNS 
, ,

modified VBN 
liberals NNS 
, , 
with IN

I PRP 
suppose VBP 
we PRP

classify VB 
Billy NNP

And CC 
I PRP 
would MD 
further RB 
note NN 
that IN 
they PRP 
all DT

again RB 
-- : 
sang VBD 
in IN 
one PRP 
key NN 
or CC 
another DT 
the DT 
same JJ 
song NN

Its PRP$ 
refrain VBG 
was VBD 
: : 
`` `` 
let VBD 
us PRP

Only RB 
Walter NNP

envisioned VBD 
the DT 
possibility NN 
of IN

`` ``

'' '' 
. . 

the DT 
most RBS 
notable JJ 
thing NN 
about RB 
the DT 
incantation NN 
of IN 
these DT 
ex-liberals NNS 
was VBD 
that IN 
the DT 
one-time JJ 
shibboleth NN 
of IN

was VBD 
conspicuously RB 
absent NN

The DT 
second NN 
specific JJ 
comment NN 
was VBD 
the DT 
report NN 
of IN 
Eisenhower NNP 
's POS 
Commission NNP 
on IN 
National JJ 
Goals NNPS 
, , 
titled VBD 
Goals NNPS 
For IN 
Americans NNPS

They PRP 
, , 
perhaps RB 
, , 
gave VBD 
the DT 
pitch VB 
of IN 
their PRP$ 
position NN 
in IN 
the DT 
preface NN 
where WRB 
it PRP 
was VBD 
said VBD 
that IN 
Eisenhower NNP 
requested VBD 
that IN 
the DT 
Commission NNP 
be VB 
administered VBN 
by IN 
the DT 
American NNP 
Assembly NNP 
of IN 
Columbia NNP 
University NNP 
, , 
because IN 
it PRP 
was VBD 
non-partisan JJ

The DT 
Commission NNP 
seems NNS 
to TO 
represent NN 
the DT 
viewpoint NN 
of IN 
what WP 
I PRP 
would MD 
call NN 
the DT 
unconscious JJ 
liberal JJ 
, , 
but CC 
not RB 
unconscious JJ 
enough RB 
, , 
to TO 
invoke VB 
the DT 
now RB 
taboo NN 
symbolism NN 
of IN 
socialism NN

And CC 
here RB 
again RB 
we PRP 
hear VB 
the DT 
same JJ 
refrain VBG 
mentioned VBD 
above IN 
: : 
`` ``

And CC 
the DT 
basic JJ 
character NN 
of IN 
that IN

has VBZ 
been VBD 
spiritual JJ 
rather RB

Ralph NNP 
Gabriel NNP 
gave VBD 
it PRP 
the DT 
name NN 
of IN 
Protestant NNP 
philosophy NN

But CC 
there RB

Here RB 
there RB

almost RB 
the DT 
only RB

One CD

this RB

In IN

whether IN

Hence RB 
the DT 
prime NN

I PRP

is VBZ 
whether IN

that IN 
whatever WDT

this RB

in IN

, , 
now RB 
the DT 
corporation NN 
per NN

can MD 
not RB 
take VB 
economic JJ

Businesses NNPS 
must MD 
develop VB 
as IN 
a DT

of IN 
the DT

and CC 
ambitions NNS 
of IN 
an DT 
individual JJ 
having VBG 
purpose NN 
and CC 
comprehensive JJ 
ability NN 
within IN 
one PRP

we PRP 
`` `` 
forced VBN

individuals NNS

assume VB 
the DT 
corporate NN 
structure NN 
by IN

of IN

and CC 
other JJ 
legal NN 
statutes NNS 
, , 
we PRP 
adopted VBD 
what WP 
I PRP 
would MD 
term JJ 
`` `` 
pseudo-capitalism JJ 
'' '' 
and CC 
so IN 
took VBD 
a DT 
major JJ 
step NN 
toward IN 
socialism NN 
. . 

The DT 
biggest JJS 
loss NN 
, , 
of IN 
course NN 
, , 
was VBD 
the DT

lessened VBD

to TO 
the DT

of IN 
his PRP

and CC 
our PRP$

Socialism NNP 
, , 
I PRP 
grant NN 
, , 
has VBZ 
a DT 
definite JJ 
place NN 
in IN 
our PRP$ 
society NN 
. . 

us PRP 
not RB 
complain VB 
of IN 
the DT 
evils NNS 
of IN 
capitalism NN 
by IN 
referring VBG 
to TO 
a DT 
form NN 
that IN 
is VBZ 
not RB 
truly RB 
capitalistic NN

Some DT 
forms NNS 
of IN 
capitalism NN 
do VB 
indeed RB 
work NN 
-- : 
superb JJ 
organizations NNS 
, , 
a DT 
credit NN 
to TO 
any DT

But CC 
the DT 
pseudo-capitalism JJ 
which WDT 
dictates NNS 
our PRP$ 
whole JJ 
economy NN 
as IN 
well RB 
as IN 
our PRP$ 
politics NNS 
and CC 
social JJ 
life NN 
, , 
will NN 
not RB 
stand NN 
close RB 
scrutiny NN 
. . 

Its PRP$ 
pretense NN 
to TO 
operate VB 
in IN 
the DT 
public JJ 
interest NN 
is VBZ 
little RB 
more NN 
than IN 
a DT 
sham NN 
. . 

It PRP 
serves NNS 
only RB 
its PRP$ 
own VB 
stockholders NNS 
and CC 
poorly RB 
at IN 
that IN

As IN 
a DT 
creative NN 
enterprise NN 
, , 
its PRP$ 
abilities NNS 
are VB 
primarily RB 
in IN 
`` ``

creative NN 
enterprises NNS 
developed VBN 
outside RB 
its PRP$

( ( 
an DT 
ability NN 
made VBD 
possible JJ 
by IN

and CC 
almost RB 
mandatory JJ 
) )

As IN 
to TO 
benefits NNS

it PRP 
is VBZ 
notorious JJ 
for IN 
its PRP$ 
callous JJ

except IN 
where WRB 
it PRP 
depends VBZ 
on IN 
them DT 
for IN

The DT 
corporation NN 
in IN 
America NNP 
is VBZ 
in IN 
reality NN 
our PRP$ 
form NN 
of IN 
socialism NN 
, , 
vying VBG 
in IN 
a DT 
sense NN 
with IN 
the DT 
other JJ 
socialistic JJ 
form NN 
that IN 
has VBZ 
emerged VBD 
within IN 
governmental JJ 
bureaucracy NN

But CC 
while NN 
the DT 
corporation NN 
has VBZ 
all DT 
the DT 
disadvantages NNS 
of IN 
the DT 
socialist RB 
form NN 
of IN 
organization NN 
( ( 
so IN 
cumbersome JJ 
it PRP 
can MD 
not RB 
constructively RB 
do VB 
much RB

anything NN 
not RB

with IN 
its PRP$

) ) 
, , 
unluckily RB 
it PRP 
does VBZ 
not RB 
have VB 
the DT 
desirable JJ 
aspect NN 
of IN 
socialism NN 
, , 
the DT 
motivation NN 
to TO 
operate VB 
for IN 
the DT 
benefit VB 
of IN 
society NN 
as IN 
a DT 
whole JJ

So IN 
we PRP 
are VB 
faced VBD 
with IN 
a DT 
vast JJ 
network NN 
of IN 
amorphous JJ 
entities NNS 
perpetuating VBG 
themselves PRP 
in IN 
whatever WDT 
manner NN 
they PRP 
can MD 
, , 
without IN

to TO 
the DT

of IN

, , 
controlling VBG 
society NN 
and CC 
forcing VBG

it PRP 
a DT 
regime NN 
representing NN 
only RB 
the DT 
corporation NN

needs NNS 
for IN

The DT 
corporation NN 
has VBZ 
a DT 
limited VBN 
, , 
specific JJ 
place NN 
in IN 
our PRP$ 
society NN

Ideally NNP 
speaking VBG 
, , 
it PRP 
should MD 
be VB 
allowed VBN 
to TO 
operate VB 
only RB 
where WRB 
the DT

has VBZ 
a DT 
great JJ 
stake NN 
in IN 
the DT 
continuity NN 
of IN 
supply RB 
or CC 
services NNS 
, , 
and CC 
where WRB 
the DT 
actions NNS 
of IN 
a DT 
single JJ 
proprietor NN 
are VB 
secondary JJ 
to TO 
the DT 
needs NNS 
of IN 
society NN

Examples NNS 
are VB 
in IN 
public JJ 
utilities NNS 
, , 
making VBG 
military NN 
aircraft NN 
and CC 
accessories NNS 
, , 
or CC 
where WRB 
the DT 
investment NN 
and CC 
risk VB

a DT

would MD 
be VB 
too RB 
great JJ 
for IN 
a DT 
much RB

project NN 
impossible JJ 
to TO

by IN 
any DT

other JJ

the DT 
corporate NN 
form NN 
, , 
e.g. NN 
constructing VBG 
major JJ 
airports NNS 
or CC 
dams NNS

Thus RB 
, , 
if IN 
corporations NNS 
are VB 
not RB 
to TO 
run NN 
away RB 
with IN 
us PRP 
, , 
they PRP 
must MD 
become VBD 
quasi-governmental JJ 
institutions NNS

subject NN 
to TO

In IN 
all DT 
other JJ 
areas VBZ 
, , 
private NN 
initiative NN 
of IN 
the DT 
`` ``

'' '' 
type NN 
should MD 
be VB

Proprietorship NNP 
Avoiding VBG

only RB

this RB

Such DT

e.g. NN

Proprietorships NNP

The DT

Leadership NNP

that IN

, ,

After IN

we PRP

better RB

Mr. NNP 
Lyford NNP

introduction NN 
as IN

He PRP

: : 
`` `` 
At IN

it PRP 
seemed VBD

how WRB

As IN

: : 
instead RB

of IN

we PRP 
have VB 
often RB

whatever WDT

to TO

at IN 
the DT 
moment NN

Such DT 
activity NN 
may MD 
or CC 
may MD 
not RB 
have VB 
irritated VBN 
the DT

it PRP 
has VBZ 
frequently RB 
condemned VBN

an DT 
unnatural JJ 
defensiveness NN 
that IN 
has VBZ 
undermined VBN 
our PRP$ 
effort NN 
to TO

to TO

The DT 
defensiveness NN 
has VBZ 
been VBD 
exaggerated VBN 
by IN 
another DT 
bad JJ 
habit NN 
, , 
our PRP$ 
tendency NN 
to TO 
rate NN 
the DT 
`` ``

the DT

areas VBZ

we PRP

Shocked JJ

we PRP

One CD

you PRP

that IN

The DT 
maturity NN 
in IN

the DT

They PRP

The DT
