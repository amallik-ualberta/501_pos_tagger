Gloom NNP

His PRP$

The DT

A DT

Matsuo NNP 
lifted VBD

easing VBG

under IN

Fresh JJ

when WRB 
his PRP

They PRP

the DT

Even RB 
now RB

like IN

he PRP 
heard VBD 
the DT

A DT

Nagamo NNP

with IN

the DT

bolted VBD

then RB

blazing VBG

The DT

When WRB

they PRP

Matsuo NNP

both DT

The DT

while IN

Matsuo NNP 
repeatedly RB

At IN 
nightfall NN 
he PRP

down IN

he PRP

into IN

He PRP

Cautious JJ

Only RB 
the DT 
hum NN

the DT 
distant JJ

Because IN

he PRP 
was VBD 
more NN 
convinced VBN

A DT 
spectacle NN 
occurred VBD 
across IN

the DT

took VBD

Humiliation NN

While IN

that IN

at IN 
the DT

Matsuo NNP 
squeezed VBD 
the DT

up IN

point NN

and CC 
then RB 
he PRP 
changed VBD 
his PRP

He PRP 
wanted VBD 
the DT 
arrogant JJ

to TO 
know VB

, , 
and CC 
so IN 
he PRP 
aimed VBD 
above IN 
the DT

The DT 
shot NN 
reverberated VBD 
in IN 
diminishing VBG 
whiplashes NNS 
of IN 
sound NN

Hush JJ 
followed VBD

Like IN 
a DT 
mischievous JJ 
boy NN 
expecting VBG 
punishment NN

Matsuo NNP 
awaited VBD 
reaction NN 
from IN 
the DT 
jungle NN

How WRB 
stupid JJ 
to TO 
give VB

The DT 
jungle NN 
did VBD 
not RB

The DT

remained VBD

hugging VBG 
the DT

Before IN

the DT 
atmosphere NN 
reverted VBD

its PRP$ 
old JJ 
normalcy NN

and CC 
insects NNS 
hummed VBD 
and CC 
birds NNS 
occasionally RB 
called VBD

Matsuo NNP 
puzzled VBN 
and CC 
grew VBD 
anxious JJ 
over IN 
the DT 
complete VB 
passiveness NN 
, , 
concluding VBG 
that IN 
he PRP 
was VBD 
the DT 
butt NN 
of IN 
a DT 
devilish JJ 
joke NN

Five CD 
or CC 
so IN 
minutes NNS 
later RB 
the DT 
marine NN 
abruptly RB 
pulled VBD 
up IN 
and CC 
stepped VBD 
into IN

immediately RB 
throwing VBG 
his PRP

He PRP 
went VBD 
into IN

a DT

It PRP 
ended VBD 
when WRB

but IN 
jumping NN 
right NN 
up IN

he PRP 
staggered VBD 
in IN 
no DT

He PRP 
wore VBD 
no DT

cover VB

more NN 
odd JJ

lurched VBD

Matsuo NNP

crossing VBG 
the DT 
meadow NN 
in IN 
a DT 
zigzagging VBG

When WRB 
he PRP 
got VBD 
closer RB 
to TO 
the DT 
tree NN 
, , 
Matsuo NNP 
noted VBD 
the DT 
wild JJ 
look NN 
on IN

The DT 
pockets NNS

The DT 
bobbing VBG

a DT 
poor JJ

so IN 
Matsuo NNP 
shot NN 
him PRP 
in IN 
the DT 
upper JJ 
trunk NN

The DT 
marine NN 
spun NN 
, , 
clapping VBG 
a DT

In IN 
the DT

Matsuo NNP

They PRP

Gradually RB 
he PRP

The DT

the DT

The DT

was VBD 
sprawled VBN 
some DT 
thirty CD

Matsuo NNP

He PRP

With IN
