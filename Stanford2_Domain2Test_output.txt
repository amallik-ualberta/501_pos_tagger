The DT

Matsuo NNP

Fresh JJ

Even RB

A DT

The DT

When WRB

Matsuo NNP

The DT

Matsuo NNP

At IN

the DT

Because IN

he PRP

A DT

While IN

Matsuo NNP 
squeezed VBD

up IN

and CC 
then RB 
he PRP

He PRP 
wanted VBD

so IN 
he PRP 
aimed VBD 
above IN

The DT 
shot NN 
reverberated VBD 
in IN 
diminishing VBG 
whiplashes NNS 
of IN

Hush JJ

Like IN 
a DT 
mischievous JJ

expecting VBG

Matsuo NNP 
awaited VBD 
reaction NN 
from IN

How WRB 
stupid JJ 
to TO

The DT

did VBD

The DT

Before IN

the DT

reverted VBD

insects NNS 
hummed VBD

birds NNS 
occasionally RB

Matsuo NNP 
puzzled VBN

grew VBD 
anxious JJ 
over IN 
the DT 
complete VB 
passiveness NN 
, , 
concluding VBG 
that IN 
he PRP 
was VBD 
the DT 
butt NN 
of IN 
a DT 
devilish JJ

Five CD

so IN 
minutes NNS

the DT

abruptly RB 
pulled VBD 
up IN

stepped VBD 
into IN

He PRP 
went VBD

It PRP

he PRP 
staggered VBD

He PRP 
wore VBD 
no RB

crossing VBG 
the DT

in IN 
a DT

When WRB 
he PRP 
got VBD 
closer RB

the DT

Matsuo NNP 
noted VBD 
the DT 
wild JJ

The DT 
pockets NNS

The DT 
bobbing VBG

so IN 
Matsuo NNP 
shot NN 
him PRP 
in IN 
the DT

The DT

spun NN

clapping VBG 
a DT

In IN 
the DT

They PRP

Gradually RB

The DT

The DT

some RB

He PRP

With IN
